# Project Asteroid game from scratch

This is a personal project to create a video game in java from A to Z without using any pre-existing game engine or physics.
The game is a reworked version of the famous arcade game Asteroids, with new features that make the gameplay even more fun but just as demanding.

The project is not yet complete; this is just the alpha version.
